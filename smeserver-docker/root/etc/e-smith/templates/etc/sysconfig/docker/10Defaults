# Other arguments to pass to the docker daemon process
# These will be parsed by the sysv initscript and appended
# to the arguments list passed to docker -d


Some notes:

# -d 	run in detached mode (like running a process in the background)
# -p 3000:3000 	map port 3000 from container to host port 3000, this is the port our app listens on
# -v $(PWD):/src 	mount the current directory which is expanded from $(PWD) as the /src folder in the container 

other_args="-g /home/e-smith/files/docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock"

# This will need setting most likely
# DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/etc/docker

Have seen some stuff like this
#if [ -z "${DOCKER_CERT_PATH}" ]; then
#    DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/etc/docker
#fi
